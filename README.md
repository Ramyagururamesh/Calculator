# Calculator
This repository features a simple yet functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports a wide range of arithmetic operations and incorporates a clean, visually appealing design.

Features
1)Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentages.
2)Advanced Functions: Includes functionality for parentheses, exponentiation, and double-zero inputs.
3)Responsive Design: Styled using CSS for a modern and interactive user experience.
4)Error Handling: Ensures unmatched parentheses and other invalid inputs are handled gracefully.
5)Interactive Buttons: Provides hover effects and feedback for better user interaction.

Technologies Used
->HTML: Structures the layout and defines the user interface of the calculator.
->CSS: Enhances visual design, including button styling and hover effects.
->JavaScript: Implements logic for operations, including input handling, operator precedence, and parentheses validation.

Project Structure
->calculator.html: Defines the structure and layout of the calculator interface.
->calculator.css: Contains styles for buttons, layout, and responsiveness.
->calculator.js: Implements the functionality of the calculator, including validation and calculation logic.
Demonstration

User Interface
*)Buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions like parentheses, exponentiation, and reset.
*)A responsive display that shows the current input and results.

Calculation Logic
The calculator uses a shunting yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix format and evaluates the postfix expression for accurate results.

Future Enhancements
*)Add memory functions (M+, M-, MC).
*)Enhance responsiveness for smaller devices.
*)Support for additional mathematical functions like square root and trigonometry.
